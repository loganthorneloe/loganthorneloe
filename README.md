## Hi, I'm Logan ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer working in AI at Google, the author of the [AI newsletter](mlforswes.com) for software engineers, and father of five. In my career, I have:

* Built AI agents to improve the developer experience and machine learning tooling at Google
* Created an [AI newsletter](mlforswes.com) specifically for those who like building software
* Built ML infrastructure at Microsoft
* Researched [applications of deep learning to medical imaging](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zFntG6MAAAAJ&hl=en)
* Developed a memory-safe method of monitoring the Azure Rack Manager at Microsoft using Rust
* Studied as a research intern at the Los Alamos National Lab

I like talking about my work, software, AI, and more. Reach out at:
