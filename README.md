## Hi, I'm LoganðŸ‘‹

I'm a machine learning infrastructure engineer at Google and I help software engineers learn AI.

I'm currently working on:
* [societysbackend.com](https://societysbackend.com): Everything you need to know about AI engineering.
* [mlroadmap.io](https://mlroadmap.io): A guide to learn ML fundamentals for free (pinned below).
* A [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@loganthorneloe) to explain AI via video.
* A collection of ML projects for beginners to gain ML experience (coming soon!).

My other projects include:
* [research](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=zFntG6MAAAAJ&citation_for_view=zFntG6MAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC) explore the feature space of segmentation CNNs.
* [research](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=zFntG6MAAAAJ&citation_for_view=zFntG6MAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC) exploring muscle activation detection via MRI.
* automation of [long-term US stock analysis using financial statements](https://github.com/loganthorneloe/stock-boy).
* an [automated Pokemon breeder](https://github.com/loganthorneloe/swsh-pokemon-breeder).
* * [a list of X accounts](https://x.com/i/lists/1738669706595258373) to follow to learn AI.

My [work experience](https://www.linkedin.com/in/loganthorneloe/) includes building ML infrastructure, instrumenting ML pipelines, [ML research applied to MRI](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zFntG6MAAAAJ&hl=en), and a brief stint in cybersecurity engineering and computational physics research.

Come find me on X, LinkedIn, and YouTube.
