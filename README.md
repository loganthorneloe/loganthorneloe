## Hi, I'm Logan ðŸ‘‹

I make TPUs go brrrr at Google and I help software engineers learn AI. Some ideas I subscribe to:

* ***You catch more flies with honey and you catch more honeys being fly.*** Be kind and be yourself. Doing both will elevate your life incredibly and immediately.
* ***You can just do things.*** You can get ahead by just acting (and AI makes this even easier!). Most people are unwilling to work for what they want. Don't be one of those people.
* ***The limit to what you can accomplish is dictated by how much you're willing to learn.*** It's never been easier to learn new information. You can achieve anything as long as you're willing to learn the skills required to do so.
* ***The most important skill anyone can master is time management.*** Things take time and it's the only resource you can never get back.
* ***Pressure is a privilege.*** If you let pressure get to you, you'll fail. If you let it motivate you, you'll achieve greatness.

I created [mlroadmap.io](https://mlroadmap.io) to help you learn ML fundamentals for free. I'm working on an ML projects repo to help you learn AI more in-depth and hands-on (stay tuned!). I [tweet](https://x.com/loganthorneloe) things I think you should know. I [write](https://societysbackend.com) to share everything you need to know about AI engineering. [Subscribe](https://societysbackend.com/subscribe) to never miss an issue! Soon, I'll translate my writing into [videos](https://www.youtube.com/@loganthorneloe) to make them even easier to consume.
