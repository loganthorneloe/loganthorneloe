## Hi, I'm Logan ðŸ‘‹

I'm a machine learning infrastructure engineer working on improving continuous ML experimentation at Google. On the side, I help software engineers understand AI so they can build better software (resources below).

My experience includes:
* Engineering continuous ML at Google.
* Engineering ML pipeline infrastructure at Microsoft.
* Researching ML applications to MRI primarily to understand the feature space of semantic segmentation neural networks. Find my research [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zFntG6MAAAAJ&hl=en).

Here are some things I'm working on:
* societysbackend.com: A newsletter to help you understanding everything you need to know about AI engineering.
* mlroadmap.io: A streamlined roadmap to help anyone learn ML fundamentals for free (see pins below).
* A collection of ML projects for beginners to gain ML experience (coming soon!).

I share ML/AI resources and lessons on X, LinkedIn, and YouTube. Feel free to reach out to me on any of those platforms.
