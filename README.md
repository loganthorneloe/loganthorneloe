## Hi, I'm Logan ðŸ‘‹

I'm an ML infra engineer at Google. My current focus in on continuous learning and increasing ML experimentation velocity and efficiency. Previously, I worked in ML infra at Microsoft and researched [ML applications of medical imaging](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zFntG6MAAAAJ&hl=e) at BYU in Provo, Utah.

I've set up a machine learning community for software engineers appropriately named [Machine Learning for Software Engineers](mlforswes.com). At it's core it's a [newsletter](mlforswes.com), [chat](https://substack.com/chat/1744179), and [repo](src.mlforswes.com) to get hands-on at the intersection of software engineering and AI. This means we explore the entire ML stack from data through training to serving with articles, tutorials, videos, and more.

I created ML for SWEs because **it's important all software engineers understand machine learning.** What was previously thought of as discipline within software engineering is actually a fundamental tool for the trade. Similar to understanding databases, APIs, network protocols, and algorithms to solve problems efficiently, software engineers will need to understand ML/AI as problems become more complex and solutions are data-driven. Machine learning is THE tool for solving interesting problems at scale and software engineers are the most important role in making those solutions reliable and accessible.

I love to chat! Find me on my socials and reach out: [X](https://x.com/loganthorneloe), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/loganthorneloe/), and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@loganthorneloe). You can find more about me below.

## More about me

I'm currently located in the Austin, TX metro. I was born in Canada and lived on the east coast of the US most of my life. I have 5 kids including 2 sets (!!) of identical twins. My favorite form of exercise is swimming. Back in the day I also played water polo. I enjoy reading comics and technical books. I also build LEGO, play video games, and tinker with things in my free time. You can checked out some of my projects in the pinned repos. My favorite thing is spending time with my kids. Nothing else compares in importance. I've got a connective tissue autoimmune diseases I manage daily. It's reframed the way I look at a lot of things and has had the biggest impact on how I prioritize things in life. I credit the person I am and the things I've achieved to the people I spend my time around. My family and close friends have molded me into who I am and have been my greatest support system.
