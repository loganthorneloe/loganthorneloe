## Hi, I'm Logan ThorneloeðŸ‘‹

I'm a machine learning infrastructure engineer at Google and I help software engineers learn AI.

I'm currently working on:
* [societysbackend.com](https://societysbackend.com): Everything you need to know about AI engineering.
* [mlroadmap.io](https://mlroadmap.io): A guide to learn ML fundamentals for free (pinned below).
* A collection of ML projects for beginners to gain ML experience (coming soon!).

My [work experience](https://www.linkedin.com/in/loganthorneloe/) includes building ML infrastructure, instrumenting ML pipelines, and [ML research applied to MRI](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zFntG6MAAAAJ&hl=en).

Come find me on X, LinkedIn, and YouTube (all linked above).
